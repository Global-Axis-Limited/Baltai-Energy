                            <p> Yes, one of the common misconceptions about solar power is that you run only certain items with the power that is produced. While this may be the case with off-grid systems, grid-tied systems do not provide power to specific devices. Instead, it simply provides a percentage of the electricity that your entire house uses.

                            <p> Solar batteries store electrical energy generated by photovoltaic panels. When solar panels generate more electricity than the electrical system demands, the excess is used to charge the batteries. Batteries transform the electrical energy they receive from photovoltaic modules into chemical energy.

                            <p> Solar inverters convert DC power input and turn it into AC power. They also act as the primary connection between the panels and the electrical distribution panel in the house.

                        <div class="faq-content">
                            <p> A solar inverter is essential for your solar panel system to convert DC electricity into AC electricity for everyday use. The process begins with sunlight striking the photovoltaic cells of solar panels, creating a flow of DC electricity. However, since most homes and electrical grids use AC electricity, the DC electricity generated by solar panels needs to be converted. This is where the solar inverter steps in. Its main task is to convert the DC electricity into AC electricity with the appropriate voltage, frequency and phase, making it suitable for powering household appliances and feeding excess energy into the electrical grid.
